# 1. Introduction

The Act Auth is an application-level protocol for both authentication and authorization in distributed, collaborative and decentralization systems.

In the Internet, various kinds of information transfer are generated every day, including public information, private information, information that is only exposed to specified objects, and information that is only exposed to specified objects under certain conditions. Among them, non-public information accounts for a large part. In order to avoid these information being acquired by unexpected objects or restrict them, some measures need to be taken between senders and receivers to control.

In transmission, since the information is relatively private and the relative private Internet can be used, while various authentication methods can be used in the public Internet. However, most of the restrictions on information still relied on multi-party agreements or real world laws and regulations, such as restrictions on the use of personal privacy information. So Act Auth is designed to be a protocol that can achieve relatively reliable information transmission and restriction in a low-confidence public Internet environment.
